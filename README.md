# Email Spam Classifier

# Description
This project is an email spam classifier that uses machine learning techniques to identify and filter spam emails. The classifier is trained on a labeled dataset of emails, distinguishing between spam and non-spam (ham) messages. It employs a combination of natural language processing (NLP) and feature extraction to analyze the content and metadata of incoming emails and make predictions.

# Key Features:
- Preprocessing: The classifier applies various preprocessing techniques, including tokenization, stop word removal, and stemming/lemmatization, to transform the raw text data into a suitable format for analysis.
- Feature Extraction: It extracts relevant features from the preprocessed email text, such as word frequencies, presence of specific keywords, and structural properties.
- Machine Learning Algorithms: The classifier utilizes popular algorithms, such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, or Random Forests, to train a model on the labeled dataset and make predictions on new, unseen emails.
- Model Evaluation: The performance of the classifier is evaluated using standard metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess its effectiveness in distinguishing between spam and non-spam emails.
- Deployment: The trained classifier can be integrated into an email system or used as a standalone application to automatically filter incoming emails and separate spam from legitimate messages.

# Requirements:
- Python: The project is implemented in Python and requires Python interpreter (version X.X or higher) to run.
- Machine Learning Libraries: It depends on popular machine learning libraries like scikit-learn, NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit), or spaCy for implementing the classifier and associated NLP tasks.
- Dataset: A labeled dataset of spam and non-spam emails is needed to train and evaluate the classifier. The dataset should be appropriately split into training and testing sets.

By using this email spam classifier, you can enhance the efficiency of email management, reduce the risk of falling victim to phishing attacks, and improve overall email communication by ensuring important messages are not lost in a sea of spam.
